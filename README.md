# Covid-19-detection-from-X-ray-images-using-deep-learning

COVID-2019, which first appeared in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, spread rapidly around the world and became a pandemic. Its very common for doctors to frequently use X-rays and CT scans to diagnose pneumonia, lung inflammation, abscesses, and/or enlarged lymph nodes. Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, X-rays can be used to analyze the health of a patient’s lungs. It could be possible to use X-rays to test for COVID-19 without the dedicated test kits.
In this repository, a new model for detecting COVID-19 using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The model developed presents accurate diagnostics for binary classification and morever achieved a classification accuracy of _________. 

# Present testing methods for Covid-19 

The most common test technique currently used for COVID-19 diagnosis is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chest radiological imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and X-ray have vital roles in early diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Due to the low RT-PCR sensitivity of 60%–70%, even if negative results are obtained, symptoms can be detected by examining radiological images of patients. It is stated that CT is a sensitive method to detect COVID-19 pneumonia, and can be considered as a screening tool with RT-PRC. CT findings are observed over a long interval after the onset of symptoms, and patients usually have a normal CT in the first 0–2 days. In a study on lung CT of patients who survived COVID-19 pneumonia, the most significant lung disease is observed ten days after the onset of symptoms.

# X-ray Image dataset used for classifier

The image dataset used for creating this classifier can be collected at - https://github.com/BIMCV-CSUSP/BIMCV-COVID-19
Number of positive covid images are - 100
Number of negative covid images are - 100

A sample image from the dataset is shown below :
